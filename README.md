# Modern-periodic-table-c-lang-The Modern Periodic Table mini project in C is designed to allow users to store and explore information about chemical elements. The main features of this project are:

Storage of Element Information: This feature allows users to add new elements with their name, symbol, atomic number, atomic weight, and other important properties. The user can input this information in a given format, and the program will store it in a file on the computer's hard disk.

Exploration of Element Information: This feature allows users to search for an element using various methods. Users can search for an element by name, symbol, atomic number, or atomic weight. The program will display the information about the element that matches the search criteria.

Termination of the Program: The project can be terminated by pressing 3 in the main menu.

Overall, this project provides a useful tool for exploring and learning about chemical elements. It can be used by students, researchers, and anyone interested in chemistry
